# Memory Models for Graphs in Rust
Representing graphs in Rust is a problematic issue, as ownership
forbids typical representations found in e.g. C++.
A common approach is to use reference counting to represent graphs,
but this can easily lead to memory leaks if cycles
are present in the graph.
As na√Øve reference counting is not sufficient,
we must search for alternative representations.
In this repository, we explore different memory models that allow
safe representations of graph-like data structures in Rust.
These memory models are later evaluated in terms of performance and usability, by using the benchmarking system provided in `src/`.

We find that region-based allocation is, in most cases,
the best model to use when performance is of importance.
In cases where usability is more important, either reference-counting
with cycle collection or tracing garbage collection is a solid choice.
When it comes to multi-threading, we propose a new implementation
of a lock-free transactional graph in Rust. To our knowledge,
this is the first lock-free graph representation in Rust.
The model demonstrates poor scalability, but for certain graph topologies and sizes, it offers performance that exceeds the other graph models.

## Memory Models
We have implemented six different graphs, located in `src/graphmodels`.

* Epoch - A lock free transactional graph that is `Send + Sync`. Uses epoch-based reclamation.
* Arc - A graph that is `Send + Sync`. Uses atomic reference counting.
* Arena - A graph that uses arena allocation.
* Cc - A graph that uses reference counting with a cycle collector to reclaim garbage cycles.
* Gc - A graph that uses tracing garbage collection to reclaim memory.
* Rc - A graph that uses reference counting.

## Benchmarks
We have ported [The GAP Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/sbeamer/gapbs), which can be run from the provided python-script.
To run a kernel, edit the provided python script.
You are also able to run a kernel directly via `cargo bench --features <kernel>`

In addition, you are able to run a custom benchmark called `OPS` that runs a custom distribution of operations.

We have also included a benchmark called `GC Bench`. This benchmark is available as a binary for each memory model.
See `src/bin` for available binaries. Make sure to run a release build when benchmarking.

The available datasets are provided by [The Koblenz Network Collection](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/)
